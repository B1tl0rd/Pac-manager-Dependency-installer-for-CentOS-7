# Pac-manager-Dependency-installer-for-CentOS-7
Simple script that will install all dependencies needed to run Pac Manager 4.5.5.7 on CentOS.
It's designed for CentOS minimal installs (cause I'm just X forwarding pac manager) and for SSH connections.

Download Pac Manager 4.5.5.7 manually from http://sourceforge.net/projects/pacmanager/files/pac-4.0/pac-4.5.5.7-all.tar.gz/download
Unpack the directory.

Run the pmdic7.sh script 

All commands are run as sudo and there are no fail checks.
